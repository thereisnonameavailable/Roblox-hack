I mean I don‚Äôt really agree with what she‚Äôs doing but at the end of the day no matter what anyone says we live in a world where we are free to do whatever we want. I know that can be debated but you know what I mean. She‚Äôs not hurting anyone or getting hurt. Maybe she‚Äôs getting emotionally hurt but she‚Äôs not lying to anyone. Their spending money on her cause they want to not because a gun is to their head  6
